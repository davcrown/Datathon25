Neurotech@Rice Track

In order to complete our model, we have a python file, x.ipynb. We also created some data visualizations to generate the plots of the correlation matricies used in our presentation, under the file corr_visualizations.R. The corr_visualizations need the Test_And_Validation.csv file in the environment, and the x.ipynb need both the Train_and_Validate_EEG.csv and Test_Set_EEG.csv.
