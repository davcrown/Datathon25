# Datathon 2025
Neurotech@Rice Track

In order to complete our model, we have a python file, Work (2).ipynb. We also created some data visualizations to generate the plots of the correlation matricies used in our presentation, under the file corr_visualizations.R. The corr_visualizations need the Test_And_Validation.csv file in the environment, and the Work (2).ipynb need both the Train_and_Validate_EEG.csv and Test_Set_EEG.csv. The Work.ipynb file has additional instructions to run the notebook at the top of the file. The xgb_results.csv file contains our output after using the Gradient Boost Model on the training set to predict the disorders in the training set.
